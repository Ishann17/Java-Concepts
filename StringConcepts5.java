/*
For Line 5 --->
The equals() method in the String class is overridden to check for content equality, but it also checks the instance type of the object itâ€™s being compared to.
Since sb is not an instance of String, this condition is false, so false is printed to the console.
For Line 6 --->
The equals() method in StringBuilder class is not overridden to check for content equality. It checks for reference equality,
which means it will only return true if sb and s point to the exact same object, which is not the case here.
So, this condition is false, and false is printed to the console.
